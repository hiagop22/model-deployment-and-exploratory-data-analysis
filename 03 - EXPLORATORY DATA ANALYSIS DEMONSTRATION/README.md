## Project Overview

This project aims to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset from the Hugging Face Datasets hub to understand the potential for predicting movie ratings based on descriptions. However, due to the limited length of the movie descriptions, the final analysis focuses on the average rating of directors to identify patterns in movie quality. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is `james-burton/imdb_genre_prediction` from the Hugging Face Datasets hub. This dataset contains various features about movies such as title, description, director, actors, year, runtime, rating, votes, revenue, metascore, and genre.

## Intent

The primary intent of this analysis is to:
1. Explore the dataset to understand its structure and content.
2. Analyze the distribution of ratings and identify any potential biases.
3. Examine the correlation between different numeric features.
4. Investigate the adequacy of movie descriptions for training NLP models.
5. Identify directors who consistently produce highly-rated movies.


## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy plotly datasets
   pip install "notebook>=5.3" "ipywidgets>=7.2"
   ```

### Running the Analysis

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook eda_movie_ratings.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the exploratory data analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis in the notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Loading and Cleaning Data**: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and check for duplicates.
2. **Initial Exploration**: Display the dataset structure and basic statistics.
3. **Distribution Analysis**: Visualize the distribution of ratings and other numeric features to identify any biases.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Compute and visualize the correlation matrix to understand relationships between features.
5. **Text Analysis**: Analyze the length of movie descriptions to assess their suitability for NLP models.
6. **Director Analysis**: Identify directors who consistently produce high-quality movies (rating above 7).

## Key Insights

- The ratings are concentrated around 6 to 8, indicating a potential bias.
- There is no significant correlation between revenue and rating.
- Movie descriptions are generally too short to provide detailed information for NLP models.
- Directors with an average rating above 7 and more than one movie can be considered reliable for producing good films.

## Observation:
Considering the case of the jupyter notebook is not rendering the ploted graphs generated by the plotly, a HTML file was also generated 
based on the jupyter notebook to provide a best visualization for the graphs.

## Conclusion

The analysis suggests that predicting movie ratings based on descriptions is challenging due to the limited length of descriptions. However, identifying directors with a track record of high ratings can be a valuable insight for investment decisions in movie production.
