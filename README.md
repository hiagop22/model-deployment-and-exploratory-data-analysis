# Project 

This repository showcases my proposed solutions to questions 2 and 3 from the Lemay.ai hiring process.

This is the main README file for the project. It provides an overview of the project and includes links to sub-READMEs.

## Subdirectories

The README files are inside each folder, there you can find the specific description for their respective project:

- [Model Deployment Demonstration](02-MODEL_DEPLOYMENT/README.md)
- [Exploratory Data Analysis](03-EXPLORATORY_DATA_ANALYSIS/README.md)

**NOTE**.: Regarding the graphs within the exploratory data analysis problem, please open the [HTML](03-EXPLORATORY_DATA_ANALYSIS/eda_movie_ratings.html) file instead of Jupyter Notebook to view them.
GitHub does not support viewing the interactive graphs.
